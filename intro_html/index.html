<p>Tron (also stylized as TRON) is a 1982 American science fiction action adventure film written and directed by Steven Lisberger from a story by Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird. The film stars Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer and video game developer who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with anthropomorphic programs in his attempt to escape. It also stars Bruce Boxleitner (in the titular role), David Warner, Cindy Morgan, and Barnard Hughes. Tron was one of cinema's earliest films to use extensive computer-generated imagery (CGI).
