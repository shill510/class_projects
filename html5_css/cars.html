    <p>Ford marketed the original Mustang as a 1965 model, though Ford made several production changes to cars built after August 1964, by which time Ford had already sold 120,000. Hobbyists refer to early Mustangs as "1964½" models, while post-August cars are "late" 1965s. The Mustang launched with convertible and notchback body styles, with the fastback joining the lineup as a late '65. A plethora of options enabled buyers to configure their Mustang as anything from an economical runabout to a weekend race car.  Total sales for the 1965 model (including "1964½" cars) was 681,000—nearly seven times Ford's projections. <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/features/ford-mustang-history-generations-models-specifications"target="_blank">-Motortrend</a>

    <p>The Mustang name is the stuff of legend. It's been said that it was named after the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, but according to the Ford Performance newsroom, the name was only ever inspired by the wild horses of the American West. However, Ford Executive Stylist John Najjar — who co-designed the first Ford Mustang prototype in 1961 — is said to have proposed the name, and he did have a fascination with World War II aircraft. Other historians believe that Ford President Lee Iacocca felt inspired by the Southern Methodist University (SMU) Mustangs college football team and wanted to name the Mustang after the team. The truth is somewhat shrouded, or maybe it's some combination of all of these stories. Which story do you believe? <a href="https://www.volocars.com/blog/history-of-the-ford-mustang"target="_blank">-Volocars</a></p>
