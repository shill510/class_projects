        <p>
            The Scraper Bike Movement started in Oakland California in the early 2000's as a way for the youth to express themselves creatively while having a way to get around. I had one in my early years of highschool that was black and grey, Radiers themed. I would get a lot of compliments on it as it was so different from the other bikes at school. I took inspiration from another kid who was older than me who had one first. He could wheelie that thing for blocks and always impressed the girls with that thing.

            Sideshows started in Oakland California as well and later spread to the rest of the world, with roots in East Oakland. There are many documentaries you can watch about how they got started and why they were even a thing in the first place. There are also many songs dedicated to and mentioning sideshows in them. I have never been to a sideshow but I have seen people do donuts and even one time had a guy do donuts around me, it was pretty cool.
