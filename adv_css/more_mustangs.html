        <h3>All about Mustangs</h3>
    <p>My Uncle had a 1965 Mustang Fastback when I was a kid. It was jet black with chrome rims. The first time he started it up with me in it I got scared. I remember driving to Skippolinis pizza with him for my birthday one year. I felt like the coolest kid in the world. He still talks about that mustang to this day with fond memories.

     <p>In highschool my best friends older cousin had a 2000 Mustand GT. He was the baddest dude I knew with a car to match. He would pick us up from school in that thing with his 2 12 inch subwoofers bumpin. We felt untouchable with him in that car. I will never forget the memories I had in that car. We felt like superstars and the toughest dudes on the island.
